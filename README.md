**Background:**
The Music Industry Sales by Format and Year dataset provides comprehensive information on the sales data for different music formats over a span of 40 years. The dataset aims to analyze and visualize the trends in music industry sales, specifically focusing on various formats and metrics used to measure these sales.

The dataset includes several key columns to facilitate data analysis, including Format which represents the different formats of music sales such as physical (CDs, vinyl) or digital (downloads, streaming). Additionally, the column Metric indicates the specific measure used to quantify the sales data, such as units sold or revenue generated. The column Year specifies the particular year in which the sales data was recorded.

To provide a more comprehensive understanding of each combination of format, metric, and year, additional columns are included. The Number of Records column denotes the total number of entries or records available for each unique combination. This information helps assess sample size reliability for further analysis. Moreover, there is an Actual Value column that presents precise numerical values representing the actual recorded sales figure corresponding to each format-metric-year combination.
